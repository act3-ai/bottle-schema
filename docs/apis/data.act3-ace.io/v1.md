Package v1 provides the Bottle types used ACE Data Bottles

### Resource Types
- [Bottle](#bottle)



#### Author



Author is a collection of information about a author.

_Appears in:_
- [Bottle](#bottle)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` _string_ | Name of the author. |
| `email` _string_ | Email of the author. |
| `url` _string_ | URL of the author's homepage. |


#### Bottle



Bottle represents the overall structure of a data set entry.json or entry.yaml



| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `apiVersion` _string_ | `bottle.data.act3-ace.io/v1`
| `kind` _string_ | `Bottle`
| `labels` _object (keys:string, values:string)_ | Labels are the bottle. The allowable grammar for the keys and values matches kubernetes. These are bottle wide labels (not to be confused with labels on individual parts). |
| `annotations` _object (keys:string, values:string)_ | Annotations are the bottle. The allowable grammar for the keys and values matches kubernetes. |
| `description` _string_ | Description is a detailed description of the bottle contents. |
| `sources` _[Source](#source) array_ | Sources is the list of sources. |
| `authors` _[Author](#author) array_ | Authors is the list of authors. |
| `metrics` _[Metric](#metric) array_ | Metrics is the list of metrics. |
| `publicArtifacts` _[PublicArtifact](#publicartifact) array_ | PublicArtifacts is the list of artifacts. |
| `deprecates` _Digest array_ | Deprecates is an array of bottle IDs that this bottle deprecates (a.k.a. supersedes). Deprecated bottles should not be used for new work. The deprecating bottle often fixes a typo or some other mistake in the deprecated bottle. |
| `parts` _[Part](#part) array_ | Parts is a list of parts (the actual data of the bottle is referred to in the parts). |


#### Metric



Metric is a collection of data about an experiment. Used to document quantifiable results in metadata

_Appears in:_
- [Bottle](#bottle)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` _string_ | Name is the name for this metric. Try to be consistent in naming of metrics. |
| `description` _string_ | Description is the detailed description of what this metric represents. |
| `value` _string_ | Value is the floating point value (stored as a string) for this metric. |


#### Part



Part represents the layout of individual file records in a bottle metadata json file

_Appears in:_
- [Bottle](#bottle)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` _string_ | Name is the path to the part in the bottle. File parts have no trailing slash. Directory parts have a trailing slash. |
| `size` _integer_ | Size is the number of bytes in the raw/uncompressed part. For files this is simply the size of the original file. For directories this is the size of the archive. |
| `digest` _Digest_ | Digest is the content digest. For files this is the digest of the file. For directories this is the digest of the archive. |
| `labels` _object (keys:string, values:string)_ | Labels to apply to the part (useful for use with part selectors to refer to partial bottles). |


#### PublicArtifact



PublicArtifact is a collection of information about files included in the bottle that should be treated specially. The path provided can be within a directory that is archived (and thus does not correspond to a bottle part directly). These files will be exposed to the telemetry server/catalog explicitly, thus should not contain sensitive information. Often artifacts are figures of merit or key evaluation/performance results outlining what is in the bottle. They must be relatively small (< 1MiB) in size for compatibility with the Telemetry server. Public artifacts are just files.  They are not allowed to be directories.

_Appears in:_
- [Bottle](#bottle)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` _string_ | Name is the human understandable name of the artifact. |
| `path` _string_ | Path is the path to the file in this bottle (this can drill down into a directory part). |
| `mediaType` _string_ | MediaType is the an RFC 2045 compliant media type for use in determining how to display this artifact. For ipynb files use "application/x.jupyter.notebook+json". |
| `digest` _Digest_ | Digest of the file. |


#### Source



Source is a definition of a data source used to track data lineage. A source is another URI (e.g., website, bottle) that this bottle was derived from. For example a bottle containing a ML model should include a source for the training set.

_Appears in:_
- [Bottle](#bottle)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` _string_ | Name is the human understandable name of the source |
| `uri` _string_ | URI points to the source. TODO document all the ways we support (the docs are in telemetry/conventions.md right now and need to move over here). |
